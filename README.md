# maana-code-challenge
This repository holds all of the codebase for the application built to satisfy
the requirements of the code challenge designated by my interviewer Roie Cohen 
at Maana. The purpose of this app is to provide some insight to my capabilities
as a programmer. This App is designed to compare two JSON based RESTful
endpoints and allow a user to map data points on the objects returned from
each endpoint.

## Installation
1. `git clone` repo into directory of your choice
2. ensure you have node v8.10.0 or later installed
   - if you have node version manager you can run `nvm use`
3. `npm install`
4. ensure webpack is installed globally with `npm i webpack -g`
5. `npm run build`
6. `npm start`
7. navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
8. PROFIT! 

## Usage
To define an integration there must be two RESTful endpoints specified, a
source endpoint that returns data when queried, and a target endpoint which
accepts data.
